PT6 Power Assurance Trending

A calculator for the daily power assurance checks required for the PT6B-36A/B engines on the Sikorsky S76-B helicopter.

The app will calculate target torque and engine limits based on outside air temp and pressure altitude, then compare those limits with indicated N1 (gas producer) speed and T5 (inter-turbine) temperature to see if you're good to go or stuck with a dud.
